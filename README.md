THE SOLUTION OF THE CODING CHALLENGE


# Link Coding Challenge

In this challenge we want you to create an app which allows you to search for a city and get back a visualization (time series graph) of the city's temperature forecast for the next 16 days.

You'll need to use Angular 6 to solve this challenge, and we have created this boilerplate so that you can dive straight into coding.

Use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the temperature forecast. You need to create an account at OpenWeatherMap (it's free) in order to get the API code. 

As for the graph, you can use whatever visualization library you prefer.

It is not necessary to style the weather app, we will leave that up to you. We are interested in strategy and how you went about to solve this task. 

## To get started

Run `npm install` to install modules. 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
